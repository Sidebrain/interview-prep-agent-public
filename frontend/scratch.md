I'll help you design a research study to understand hiring costs and time across different roles. Let me break this down systematically.





# Research Objective
To quantify the total cost and time investment required for hiring across different roles, accounting for variations in interview processes and interviewer compositions.

# Data Collection Framework

## Basic Information
- Company size
- Industry
- Role being hired for
- Level of role (junior, mid, senior, leadership)
- Location/market
- Typical salary range for the role

## Process Mapping
For each stage of the hiring process:

### 1. Initial Screening
- Number of applications reviewed
- Time spent per application review
- Recruiter hourly cost
- ATS/tools cost per hire

### 2. Initial Interview (Recruiter)
- Average number of candidates screened
- Length of screening interview
- Recruiter hourly cost
- Scheduling/coordination time
- Tools cost (video conferencing, scheduling software)

### 3. Technical/Role-Specific Assessments
- Type of assessment used
- Time to review each assessment
- Cost of assessment tools/platforms
- Reviewer time and cost

### 4. Team Interviews
For each interviewer type:
- Role/level of interviewer
- Hourly cost of interviewer
- Interview duration
- Number of interviews conducted
- Interview preparation time
- Post-interview feedback time
- Interview panel composition by role type

### 5. Final Stage
- Final interview duration
- Senior stakeholder time cost
- Decision-making meeting duration
- Number of participants

## Time Metrics
- Time to fill (from job posting to offer accepted)
- Time to hire (from first application to offer accepted)
- Time per stage
- Calendar time lost between stages
- Scheduling lag time
- Feedback collection time
- Decision-making time

## Cost Metrics
- Direct costs:
  - Job posting fees
  - Agency fees (if applicable)
  - Assessment tool costs
  - Background check costs
  - Travel/accommodation for candidates
- Indirect costs:
  - Total interviewer time cost
  - Recruitment team time cost
  - Administrative support time cost
  - Tool and software costs
  - Training costs for interviewers

## Opportunity Costs
- Revenue impact of position vacancy
- Team productivity impact
- Project delay costs
- Customer impact costs

## Role-Specific Interview Panels

### Technical Roles (Engineering, Data Science)
- Technical lead/manager
- Peer engineers
- Product manager
- System architect
- Engineering director

### Design Roles
- Design manager
- Product manager
- Engineer
- Marketing representative
- UX researcher

### Sales Roles
- Sales manager
- Account executive
- Sales operations
- Customer success manager
- Product specialist

### Product Roles
- Product director
- Engineering lead
- Design lead
- Business stakeholder
- Technical product manager

# Data Analysis Framework
- Cost per hire by role type
- Time per hire by role type
- Interview hours per hire
- Conversion rates between stages
- Cost breakdown by stage
- Time breakdown by stage
- Impact of interview panel composition on success rates
- Correlation between interview time investment and candidate quality
- ROI analysis of different assessment methods

# Success Metrics
- Offer acceptance rate
- New hire retention rate (6 months, 1 year)
- Hiring manager satisfaction
- Time to productivity for new hires
- Quality of hire metrics


To help you collect and organize this data effectively, I'll create a data collection template in Excel format.



```markdown
# Excel Template Structure

## Sheet 1: Company & Role Info
Columns:
- Company_ID
- Company_Size
- Industry
- Role_Title
- Role_Level
- Location
- Target_Salary_Range_Min
- Target_Salary_Range_Max
- Department

## Sheet 2: Process Timeline
Columns:
- Role_ID (foreign key)
- Stage_Name
- Stage_Start_Date
- Stage_End_Date
- Number_of_Candidates
- Conversion_Rate
- Stage_Owner

## Sheet 3: Interview Panels
Columns:
- Role_ID
- Interview_Stage
- Interviewer_Title
- Interviewer_Level
- Interviewer_Hourly_Cost
- Interview_Duration
- Prep_Time
- Feedback_Time
- Number_of_Interviews_Conducted

## Sheet 4: Direct Costs
Columns:
- Role_ID
- Cost_Category (job posting, agency, tools, etc.)
- Amount
- Frequency
- Notes

## Sheet 5: Time Investment
Columns:
- Role_ID
- Activity_Type
- Role_Involved
- Time_Spent
- Frequency
- Impact_on_Timeline

## Sheet 6: Success Metrics
Columns:
- Role_ID
- Metric_Name
- Value
- Target
- Variance
- Notes

## Sheet 7: Summary Dashboard
- Automated calculations for:
  - Total cost per hire
  - Total time to hire
  - Cost breakdown by stage
  - Time breakdown by stage
  - Interview hours per hire
  - Success metrics summary

```

To effectively use this framework, I recommend:

1. Start with a pilot study of 3-5 companies across different sizes to validate the data collection approach

2. Focus on collecting data for key roles first:
   - Software Engineer
   - Product Manager
   - Sales Representative
   - Designer
   These roles have distinct interview processes and will give you good coverage of different panel compositions

3. When analyzing the data, pay special attention to:
   - The correlation between interview panel complexity and hiring success
   - The trade-off between time invested and quality of hire
   - The variance in costs across different roles and company sizes

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the research framework or data collection template? I can also help you think through specific metrics for particular roles or develop interview questions for the study.
