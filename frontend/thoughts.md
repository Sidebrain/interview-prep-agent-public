SOme things ot think through after

- [ ] In the completion frame chunk, do I need the object field? I feel like I can just check the type field. `object` and `type` in the WebsocketFrame as concepts overlap. Maybe you can use a `signal.regenerate` type syntax to route

Trials:
- Use teh compeletion Frame chunk id to locate the frameId in the backend
